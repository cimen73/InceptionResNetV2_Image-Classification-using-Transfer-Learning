# InceptionResNetV2_Image-Classification-using-Transfer-Learning

<h2>Image Classification Using Transfer Learning</h2>

<p>In the project, I used the InceptionResNetV2 model trained on the imageNet dataset.
The ImageNet dataset covers 1000 object classes and includes 1,281,167 training images, 50,000 validation images, and 100,000 testing images.
It is a very large dataset for training and it takes a lot of time to download and use such a large dataset on a normal computer
In addition, the InceptionResNetV model is a complex model with 164 layers. It consists of Inception and ResNet model architectures.
InceptionResNetV classifies images into 1000 object categories.
InceptionResNetV has an image input size of 299x299 pixels.</p>

<p>In this project, image classification was done using Transfer Learning.</p>

<p>In this project, we will perform image classification using Transfer Learning. For this purpose, we will use the InceptionResNetV2 model trained on the imageNet dataset. I used a submarine image for classification. I found this image on the internet, this image is not included in the imageNet dataset used for training InceptionResNetV2.</p>

<p>In transfer learning, we use a model that has been previously trained on a dataset and includes weights and biases that represent properties of the dataset on which it is trained.</p>

<p>Inception and ResNet are among the best image recognition performance models of recent years with their very good performance at relatively low computational cost.</p>
